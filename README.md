## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- DOM Manipulation
- Functions
- Arrays
- addEventListener

### What I learned

I learned to manipulate the DOM in different ways, to use addEventListener, create a delay.


```
<div class="gryffindorHouse hide">
    <img class="coat-of-arms" src="assets/images/grifinoria.gif" alt="Gryffindor image">
    <h2 class="H-result">Gryffindor!</h2>
    <p class="H-about">Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Godric Gryffindor. Godric instructed the sorting hat to choose a few particular characteristics he most values. Such character traits of students Sorted into Gryffindor are courage, chivalry, and determination.</p>
</div>
```
```css
.hide {
  display: none;
}
```
```js
function delay(n){
    return new Promise(function(resolve){
        setTimeout(resolve,n*1000);
    });
}
```


### Continued development
